1. Description Electricity Billing System for:
    An electricity billing system is a system that calculates and generates bills for the consumption of electricity by customers.
    It typically includes a meter to measure the amount of electricity used, a database to store customer information and usage data,
    and a billing module to calculate the charges based on the rates established by the utility company.
    The system may also provide the ability to view and pay bills online, as well as track usage and consumption history.


2. An electricity billing system in Java flow diagram would typically involve the following steps:

    Data input: The customer's meter reading, name, address, and account number are entered into the system through a
    user interface built using Java.

    Bill calculation: The system calculates the bill amount using Java programming logic based on the meter reading, customer information, and the rates established by the utility company.

    Bill generation: The system generates the bill in the form of a pdf or other document using Java libraries such as iText.

    Bill distribution: The bill is distributed to the customer via email or an online portal built using Java technologies such as Servlets and JSP.

    Payment processing: The customer can view and pay the bill using a Java-based web application that integrates with payment gateways.

    Payment confirmation: The system records the payment and updates the customer's account in the database using Java database connectivity (JDBC)
